*A crossplatform Livesplit Alternative* 

## Why another timer
   Since Livesplit have support for memory watch for windows, and now the crossplatform solution of the it is kinda meh(sorry), I felt     like we need a new timer that supports extensions, memory watch and so

## So extensions
   By the moment we are thinking on IronPython (Maybe other languages but for now IronPython it is) to extended the program by a plugins system I expect it to be pretty useful, at least to play bingos, randomizers and such.

## Memory Watcher
  So, yeah, since ASL is a pretty cool way to split local games, why not use it, we will slowly implement this, but I expect to be possible to split with that

## Web version?
  No? I don't plan to do it but if someone wants to use blazor or something to implement it you are welcome
